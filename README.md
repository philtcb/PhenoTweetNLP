# PhenoTweetNLP
Master Project for Differentiating Phenology-related Tweets

TFIDF+LDA.ipynb: Uses TFIDF to vectorize all Tweets, then feed into LDA to generate topics
bart_zero_shot_method.ipynb: Uses BART+ Zero_Shot Learning, model from Huggingface called bart-mnli.

## Improvemnets to be made:
BART: change keyword selections, depending on the tasks (coarse-grain: keyword as separated as possible; fine-grain: include multi-true label, can have similar keywords)
